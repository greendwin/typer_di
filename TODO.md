# Roadmap

## MS-1 - pypi
- [x] 📖 write detailed description with code examples
- [x] ⭐ push this repo to `github`
- [x] ⭐ push package to pypi (create tokens and etc., research it!)

## MS-2 - v0.1.0
- [x] ✍️ **NO** include all `typer` declarations to `typer_di` (like in examples above)
- [x] ✍️ support *future* `annotations`
- [x] ✍️ fix tests up to py3.7
- [x] 📖 specify supported python versions
- [ ] 🐞 dependency can be called multiple times in `callback` and `command`: we need to cache such calls through whole program execution
- [ ] 📖 add patch notes
- [ ] ⭐ publish `v0.1.0`
